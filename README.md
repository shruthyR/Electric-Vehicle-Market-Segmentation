# Electric-Vehicle-Market-Segmentation
Background The electric vehicle industry in India is a growing industry. Electric Vehicles include a large range of vehicles from electric two - wheelers, three - wheelers (rickshaws), cars and electric buses. An electric vehicle can be classified on the basis of their attributes such as charging time, driving range, and the maximum load it can carry. Of these attributes, the two most important characteristics of an electric vehicle of concern to the consumer are: Driving range(i.e. Maximum distance an EV can run when fully charged) Charging time of batteries(i.e. the time required to fully charge the battery) and Charging time depends on the input power characteristics (i.e. input voltage and current), battery type and battery capacity. Therefore, such a vehicle is seen as a possible replacement for current-generation automobiles, in order to address the issue of rising pollution, global warming, depleting natural resources, etc. In this paper, our motto is to obtain information on the present Electrical Vehicle market in India using Business Analytics and Market Segmentation techniques. A detailed analysis of the various aspects of Indian EVâ€™s and its customer base is carried out through machine learning techniques such as Clustering. The case study focuses on the clustering pipeline using limited amounts of data obtained from several trusted platforms, including government open source
